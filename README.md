# Conditional

This is a little tool to visualize your conditionals as part of a truth table and compare differences between multiple statements for a desired effect.

### Backstory

This is my last year of high school and I am getting some juniors prepped for the AP Computer Science test. They wanted to go more in depth on truth tables, but rote memorization sucks. So this is a tool that makes even multi-variable conditions easier to grasp. Perhaps they are not the only ones who will find this useful, so here you go internet.
