### Backstory

This is my last year of high school and I am getting some juniors prepped for the AP Computer Science test. They wanted to go more in depth on truth tables, but rote memorization sucks. So this is a tool that makes even multi-variable conditions easier to grasp. Perhaps they are not the only ones who will find this useful, so here you go internet.

**Update:** Nine months (one human baby) later, I decided to come back to this tool and improve the logic parsing logic and add more connectives, along with simpler code and user interface and performance improvements.
